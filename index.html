            Hi I'm Luke, I'm currently a Configuration Analyst specializing in Marketing at a company called
            VizExplorer, based in beautiful San Diego California.
            VizExplorer is a software company focusing on improving operational intelligence to maximize client revenue
            streams. Currently we're making huge strides
            in improving the casino gaming industry through the use of proprietary data visualization software as well
            as industry expertise. I specifically am responsible
            for deployments and upgrades of VizExplorer software with a heavy influence on the progression of new
            technology and products. </p>
         <br>
         <p class="bodyText clearfix">
            I graduated with a computer science degree from San Diego State University in the fall of 2016. I wanted to
            be a developer since the 8th grade. What kicked off my fascination
            for development was of course video games! Currently I'm enrolled in UCSD's Full Stack Development Bootcamp
            for more practical experience. If you have a chance, check out my
            portfolio!
         </p>
         <p class="bodyText clearfix">
            In my depressingly small amount of freetime, I enjoy playing video games! Legend of Zelda, Fire Emblem,
            Hearthstone, and Final Fantasy are some titles that I'm playing right now.</p>
